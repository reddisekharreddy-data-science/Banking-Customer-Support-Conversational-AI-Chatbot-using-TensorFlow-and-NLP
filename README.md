# Banking-Customer-Support-Conversational-AI-Chatbot-using-TensorFlow-and-NLP
This project is an AI-powered Banking Customer Support Chatbot that understands customer queries, detects intent, extracts important entities, and retrieves the most relevant answers using deep learning and NLP. It supports common banking topics such as accounts, cards, loans, balances, KYC, and more.
The chatbot uses:

##Bidirectional LSTM for intent classification

Named Entity Recognition using spaCy

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for answer retrieval

Universal Sentence Encoder for embeddings

FAISS for semantic similarity search

Streamlit web interface for interaction

TensorFlow backend for model inference
